# Ballistic Delivery of Humanitarian Aid

## Project Overview
This project explores the feasibility and technical implementation of using ballistic projectiles for the rapid point-to-point delivery of humanitarian aid. Motivated by historical concepts such as Project HARP and modern advancements by SpaceX and Rocket Lab, this repository models the physics, optimization, and detection of ballistic trajectories on Earth.

The core objective is to develop a high-fidelity numerical simulation that predicts impact locations, optimizes launch parameters for minimal flight time, and models the radar cross-section and detection windows for incoming payloads.

## Repository Structure

The project is divided into five core computational modules:

### 1. Numerical Simulation of Trajectories
This module implements the full Equations of Motion (EoM) for a ballistic projectile in a rotating reference frame.
* **Coordinate Systems:** Utilizes Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates for integration and East-North-Up (ENU) for local launch parameters.
* **Force Models:** Includes variable gravitational acceleration, aerodynamic drag (dependent on Mach number and altitude-based air density), Coriolis force, and centrifugal force.
* **Integration:** Uses numerical methods (Runge-Kutta via `solve_ivp`) to propagate the state vector from launch to impact.

### 2. Trajectory Optimization
This module solves the inverse problem: determining the optimal launch azimuth, elevation, and minimum required velocity to strike a specific target coordinate.
* **Objective Function:** Minimization of total time-of-flight and energy requirements.
* **Constraints:** Impact accuracy within ±0.001° latitude/longitude.
* **Scenarios:** Optimization of delivery routes from specific launch silos (e.g., Minot AFB) to designated aid delivery locations globally.

### 3. Predictive Modeling
This section implements a predictive framework (Physics-Informed or Machine Learning) to estimate the final landing position based on mid-flight telemetry.
* **Methodology:** Trains on datasets generated by the numerical simulator to correlate intermediate velocity and position vectors with final impact points.
* **Validation:** Verified against the rigorous numerical trajectories generated in the first module.

### 4. Radar Coverage and Detection Analysis
This module simulates the defensive tracking of ballistic aid projectiles to ensure safety and identification.
* **Scenario:** Models a military-grade radar station located in Siberia (e.g., Norilsk or Yakutsk).
* **Detection Volume:** Calculates 3D radar coverage including azimuth, elevation limits, and maximum range ($R_{max}$).
* **Analysis:** Determines the precise time of detection for trajectories originating from North America, the duration required for ballistic confirmation, and the estimated position at the moment of confirmation. It also accounts for Earth curvature and horizon range ($R_h$).

### 5. Visualization
A suite of visualization tools to render the data in a geospatial context.
* **3D Globe Rendering:** Plots trajectories over a 3D Earth model with realistic geography overlays.
* **Volumetric Analysis:** Visualizes the radar detection frustum (spherical sector) and its intersection with projectile flight paths.
* **Animation:** Dynamic representation of the flight path and detection events.

## Technical Details

### Physical Constants and Models
* **Earth Model:** WGS84 standard radius ($R_{Earth} \approx 6378 km$) and rotation rate ($\omega_{Earth} \approx 7.29 \times 10^{-5}$ rad/s).
* **Aerodynamics:** Drag coefficient ($C_D$) is modeled as a function of Mach number ($M$), accounting for supersonic and subsonic flow regimes.
* **Gravity:** Adjusted for altitude $h$ at every integration step.

### Mathematical Formulation
The simulation solves the differential equation for position vector $\mathbf{r}$ in the ECEF frame:

$$\frac{d^2\mathbf{r}}{dt^2} = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{\mathbf{F}_{drag}}{m} - 2\boldsymbol{\omega}_{Earth} \times \frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt} - \boldsymbol{\omega}_{Earth} \times (\boldsymbol{\omega}_{Earth} \times \mathbf{r})$$

Where $\mathbf{F}_{drag}$ is the aerodynamic drag force, opposing the velocity vector relative to the atmosphere.

## Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* NumPy (Vectorization and coordinate transformations)
* SciPy (Numerical integration and optimization)
* Matplotlib (Static and 3D plotting)

## Usage
1.  **Simulation:** Run the simulation script to generate a trajectory based on initial ENU parameters (velocity, azimuth, elevation).
2.  **Optimization:** Input a target latitude/longitude to compute the required launch parameters.
3.  **Radar Analysis:** Define radar coordinates and beam parameters to test detection capabilities against generated trajectories.
